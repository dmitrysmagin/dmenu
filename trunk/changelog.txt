- added Shutdown Delay option; if idle in dmenu for N seconds, dingoo will
  automatically power off -- unless it is currently charging
- enabled charging detection for battery icon & added charging icon
- watch and clockspeed font colour now matches user's chosen font colour
- dmenu.ini is written if volume or brightness are changed
- fixed a write to .tmp (now /tmp/.tmp)
TODO: stabilize charging detection so it doesn't flipflop
TODO: get brightness, sound & battery colour to match chosen font colour
TODO: If usb cable is plugged in but dingoo is not charging, it will
power off if idle past shutdown time, this causes it to reboot needlessly.
Fix it to recognize usb cable even if not charging.
TODO: Change hold-switch from using proc to using SDL key pause

- Removed the loading status bar from the loading screen. This increased
 loading speed noticably.
- When the backlight is turned off after the dim timeout, the next keypress
 will turn the backlight on but will not be processed - i.e. if you press A
 when the screen is dark, it won't immediately launch whatever icon was active
 when the dimmer came on. (was driving me crazy hehe)
- Added the option to display the clock speed in MHz as part of the on screen
 display.
- Added the setting "SpeedDisp = true/false" in the dmenu.ini file for
 controlling display of the clock speed.
- Moved all transient writes from the dmenu active directory to /tmp (.tmp,
 .next, .screen)
- Disabled dmenu writing dmenu.ini every time it closes; dmenu.ini is written
 to when the theme, background or font colour is changed.
- Select + Start to exit dmenu instead of Select.
- Menu scroll animation

- Various bug fixes
- Added ability to use global resources in themes.  
    If you prefix a path in a theme with 'global:' it will pick up
    the file from the "resources" directory.  This allows for the sharing of 
    fonts, sounds, images, etc.  Hopefully this will reduce the overall
    disk footprint of the menu.  Not sure, but the menu may also run
    better if multiple code points are using the same resource on disk 
    instead of copies of the same resource.  An example from default/theme.cfg:

        Font = "global:FreeSans.ttf"

- Ensuring the menu will work when filesystem is read only.
    Performance will degrade in some cases, but the menu should function
    in the same way it has before.  Just maybe a little bit slower.
- Memory Leak resolved in colorpicker
- Show/Take snapshot of menu on exit/load.  
    This allows for the menu to show something while it is setting up.
- Theme Selection now uses the image selection tool.  
    The theme selector will look for a 'theme.png' in the root of all valid
    theme folders (themes where theme.cfg exists).  If a theme preview
    is not found, it will use the 'notfound.png' in the resources folder.
- UI enhancements to the main menu
    We now apply alpha blending to the menu items based on their distance
    from the active item.  If the submenu is open, then another layer
    of blending is applied to the horizontal menu, as well as the 
    submenu's parent.  The goal with this was to help indicate which
    parts of the menu are active, and which aren't.  
- Set foundation for UI animations
- Replaced sound OSD format of icon and percantage to just an icon.  
    The icon now shows the level of sound visually in lieu of a 
    percentage
- UI will now autodim after a period of N seconds.
    The default for N is 5, but is configurable in the dmenu.ini file under
    they key DimmerDelay.  The value for DimmerDelay is an integer which represents
    seconds.  If DimmerDelay is set to 0, then the dimming will not occur.
- Enabled themes to define padding between icon and text, when the text is right
  of the icon.
    This does not apply to the horizontal items, but the vertical menu items.  The
    key to set in the theme.cfg is ItemTextPadLeft and the value is an integer which
    represents the left padding of the text, in pixels.

will display the UTF8 chars accordingly. Font file specified by the theme need
to contain the necessary chars.
- Menu wrapping when left or right key pressed at begining or end of Menu
respectively. Same for MenuItem (up/down).
- File selector wrapping at begining and end of file list.
- Easier file selection. Use Y + up/down to scroll 1 page at a time
- Added OSD.

- Fixed a display bug where the menu items above the mainmenu are overlapping
- Execute programs directly instead of via '/bin/sh' to reduce memory usage
- Re-structured config files to add theme support and reading config from
application directories. See readme.txt for details.

[0.2a]
- Dynamically link against libconfuse since it's provided by the rootfs.
- Remove the mechanism to restart dmenu after the executed program has finished.
Not required since dmenu is respawn by init.
